# MVVM Architecture

FlipEdit implements the Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern with a clean separation of concerns to enhance maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## Key Components and Responsibilities

- **Model**: Defines application data and business rules.
- **View**: The user interface displaying information and capturing user input.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as the intermediary between the View and Model, encapsulating UI-related state and implementing business logic.

## ViewModel and Command Interaction

### Separation of Concerns in FlipEdit

- The **ViewModel** handles all state calculation and mutation logic. It decides *what* changes need to happen to the timeline state (e.g., placing clips, trimming, handling overlaps).
- The **Command** pattern is used to perform persistence mutations. Commands take the state changes from the ViewModel and execute them against the data persistence layer (e.g., database), ensuring transactional integrity and enabling features like undo/redo.

### Benefits

- This split improves testability:
  The ViewModel can be tested independently of the database, focusing on business logic and state transitions.
- Commands abstract the persistence layer, managing database transactions and encapsulating user actions.
- Commands facilitate implementing undo/redo mechanics by encapsulating discrete changes.

## Summary

In FlipEdit, the MVVM architecture is extended with a Command pattern to cleanly separate state mutation (ViewModel) from persistence mutation (Commands). This design leads to a robust and maintainable codebase, where business logic remains testable and persistent state changes are consistently managed.


### Model Layer

In FlipEdit, models contain the core business logic and data structures:

```dart
// Core model class
class Project {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final List<Clip> clips;
  final Map<String, dynamic> settings;
  
  // Methods for business logic
  void addClip(Clip clip) { ... }
  void removeClip(String clipId) { ... }
  
  // Serialization
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() { ... }
  factory Project.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) { ... }
}
```

Models are:
- Immutable where possible
- Responsible for their own serialization
- Focused on business logic
- Independent of UI concerns

### ViewModel Layer

ViewModels serve as the bridge between Models and Views:

```dart
class ProjectViewModel {
  // State exposed as ValueNotifier objects
  final ValueNotifier<Project?> currentProjectNotifier = ValueNotifier<Project?>(null);
  
  // Getters and setters for convenient access
  Project? get currentProject => currentProjectNotifier.value;
  set currentProject(Project? value) {
    if (currentProjectNotifier.value == value) return;
    currentProjectNotifier.value = value;
  }
  
  // Computed properties for UI convenience
  String get projectName => currentProject?.name ?? 'No Project';
  bool get hasProject => currentProject != null;
  
  // User actions
  Future<void> loadProject(String projectId) async {
    final project = await _projectService.getProject(projectId);
    currentProject = project;
  }
}
```

ViewModels in FlipEdit:
- Expose state through `ValueNotifier` objects
- Provide convenient getters and setters
- Implement computed properties for UI convenience
- Handle user actions
- Coordinate with services for data operations
- Don't contain UI code

### View Layer

Views represent the UI and observe ViewModels for changes:

```dart
class ProjectScreen extends StatelessWidget with WatchItMixin {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Watch for changes in ValueNotifier properties
    final project = watchValue(
      (ProjectViewModel vm) => vm.currentProjectNotifier
    );
    
    final hasProject = project != null;
    final projectName = project?.name ?? 'No Project';
    
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(projectName)),
      body: hasProject 
        ? ProjectEditorWidget()
        : Center(child: Text('No project loaded')),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () => di<ProjectViewModel>().createProject('New Project'),
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Views in FlipEdit:
- Use `WatchItMixin` to observe `ValueNotifier` properties
- Contain only UI logic
- Don't manipulate models directly

## Communication Between Components

### ViewModel to View Communication

ViewModels communicate with Views through `ValueNotifier` properties:

1. ViewModel updates a `ValueNotifier` property
2. Views observing that property automatically rebuild

### View to ViewModel Communication

Views communicate with ViewModels by calling methods:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () => di<PlayerViewModel>().togglePlayPause(),
  child: Icon(isPlaying ? Icons.pause : Icons.play_arrow),
)
```

### ViewModel to Model Communication

ViewModels manipulate models directly or through services:

```dart
Future<void> addEffect(String clipId, EffectType type) async {
  final clip = currentProject?.clips.firstWhere((c) => c.id == clipId);
  if (clip != null) {
    final newEffect = await _effectService.createEffect(type);
    final updatedClip = clip.copyWith(
      effects: [...clip.effects, newEffect]
    );
    
    // Create a new project with the updated clip
    final updatedProject = currentProject!.copyWith(
      clips: currentProject!.clips.map((c) => 
        c.id == clipId ? updatedClip : c
      ).toList()
    );
    
    // Update the current project
    currentProject = updatedProject;
  }
}
```

## Dependency Injection

FlipEdit uses the `watch_it` package for dependency injection, which provides a global `di` instance:

```dart
// Registering dependencies
void setupServiceLocator() {
  // Register services
  di.registerLazySingleton<ProjectService>(() => ProjectService());
  
  // Register ViewModels
  di.registerLazySingleton<ProjectViewModel>(() => ProjectViewModel());
}

// Accessing dependencies in code
final projectViewModel = di<ProjectViewModel>();
```

## Benefits in FlipEdit

The MVVM architecture in FlipEdit provides several advantages:

1. **Clean code organization** - Each component has a clear responsibility
2. **Testability** - ViewModels can be unit tested without UI
3. **Flexibility** - UI can change without affecting business logic
4. **Reactivity** - UI automatically updates when data changes
5. **Reusability** - ViewModels can be used across different views
