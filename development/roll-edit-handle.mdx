## Overview: What is a Roll Edit Handle?

A **roll edit handle** is an interactive UI element on the timeline track that enables users to perform "roll edits"â€”modifying the boundary between two adjacent clips without affecting the total timeline duration. This handle appears between two clips that can be roll-edited, visually indicating the edit point.

- **Location:** Appears at the junction between two adjacent timeline clips (e.g., in the timeline track UI).
- **Purpose:** Lets users offset the cut point between two clips by dragging without introducing gaps or overlaps in the timeline.

## User Interaction and Behavior

- **Hover Feedback:**  
  - When a user hovers over a roll edit handle, it changes appearance (e.g., highlighted, color accent, or cursor change) to indicate interactivity.
- **Drag Operation:**  
  - Click-and-drag horizontally to move the cut point between two clips:
    - One adjacent clip's end and the other's start adjust in sync.
    - No gap or overlap is introduced.
- **Affected Elements:**  
  - Only the two directly adjacent clips are modified.
  - Playback position and other timeline elements remain unaffected.

**Example Flow:**
1. Hover over the roll edit handle between two clips.
2. Drag left or right; see both clip boundaries adjust in real-time.
3. Release to apply the roll edit.

## Widget Structure & MVVM Responsibilities

The roll edit functionality is implemented using the MVVM architecture, providing modularity and testability.

- **Main Widget:**  
  - [`RollEditHandle`](../../../lib/views/widgets/timeline/components/roll_edit_handle.dart)  
    Responsible for rendering the handle UI, hover/drag interactions, and feedback.
- **Parent Widget:**  
  - [`TimelineTrack`](../../../lib/views/widgets/timeline/timeline_track.dart)  
    Manages track content and arranges roll edit handles between clips.
- **ViewModel:**  
  - [`TimelineViewModel`](../../../lib/viewmodels/timeline_viewmodel.dart)  
    Maintains state (e.g., which handles are enabled, drag state), exposes commands for roll edits.
- **Service(s):**  
  - [`TimelineClipResizeService`](../../../lib/services/timeline_clip_resize_service.dart)  
    Controls roll logic, constraints, and validation of allowed operations.
- **Command:**  
  - [`RollEditCommand`](../../../lib/viewmodels/commands/roll_edit_command.dart)  
    Encapsulates logic for applying a roll edit to two clips, with undo/redo support.

**MVVM Data Flow:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    User -- drag/hover --> RollEditHandle
    RollEditHandle -- events --> TimelineViewModel
    TimelineViewModel -- invokes --> RollEditCommand
    RollEditCommand -- delegates to --> TimelineClipResizeService
    Service -- validation/processing --> TimelineViewModel
    TimelineViewModel -- notifies --> TimelineTrack/Clip widgets
```

- **Bindings:** The `RollEditHandle` widget uses bindings (e.g., `ValueListenable`, state management) to update UI based on ViewModel changes.

---

## Inspector Integration

The roll edit handle appears as a discrete node in the timeline widget tree when present.

- **Widget Tree:**  
  - Appears as a child under the corresponding `TimelineTrack` widget, typically between two `TimelineClip` widgets.
- **Inspectable States:**  
  - **Idle:** Not active, only visible when roll edit is possible.
  - **Hover/Highlight:** Visual state when hovered, showing feedback.
  - **Dragging:** State during user drag; can inspect position and affected clips in the tree.
- **Inspector Tracking:**  
  - Developers can trace roll edit handle creation, interactivity, and state changes directly in Flutter Inspector.
  - Useful for debugging user interaction, binding propagation, and state management.

---

## Known Issues & Future Work

- **TODO:**  
  - Improve type compatibility for `RollEditCommand`. The current implementation may benefit from further type safety and abstraction.
- **Planned:**  
  - Investigate and design UI solutions for cases where two roll handles are near-adjacent (e.g., when multiple edits are very close or "stacked").
  - Possible future enhancements to feedback, accessibility, or Inspector aids.

---

## Example Usage (Code Snippet)

```dart
// Example: Creating a RollEditHandle between two TimelineClips

TimelineTrack(
  children: [
    TimelineClip(...),
    RollEditHandle(
      // properties: clipA, clipB, onRollEdit callback...
    ),
    TimelineClip(...),
  ],
)
```

## Architectural Notes

- Roll edit maintains strict MVVM separation.
- All user actions (hover, drag) flow through the view and are dispatched as commands to the ViewModel.
- The ViewModel coordinates with services to enforce logic, ensuring widget code stays UI-focused.
